# Python Tutorials

I have created this repository to practice simple programs in python language.

I'm learning from [LinkedIn course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-the-c-sharp-developer-2018/), and a wonderful interactive learning experience from [Learn Python Org](https://www.learnpython.org/) website.
